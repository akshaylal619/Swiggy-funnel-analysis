# Swiggy Funnel Analysis - Business Case Study

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth **Funnel Analysis** for Swiggy, one of Indiaâ€™s largest food e-commerce platforms. As part of a simulated business scenario, I took the role of a **Growth & Strategy Analyst** tasked with analyzing Swiggy's session-to-order funnel performance for 2019. The analysis uncovers insights on user behavior, conversion drop-offs, and performance fluctuations using structured Excel data.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- Multiple spikes in orders observed during weekends â€” aligned with natural user behavior.
- Specific weekdays showed significant order drops (>20%) due to lower payment success or traffic shifts.
- Fluctuations in **Menu-to-Cart (M2C)** and **Payment-to-Order (P2O)** stages were most influential in overall conversion drop-offs.
- Supporting factors like **average discounts**, **out-of-stock items**, and **delivery charges** had measurable impacts.
